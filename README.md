# logic-articulations-settings
A Collection of articulations settings for various libraries for Logic Pro X

To install the files, simply clone the repository and copy the files or the whole directories as needed into you local "~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings" directory.

The project maintains a directory structure for easy of use and it will show as a hierarchy insdie Logic Pro, which is very convenient especially if you have a lot of libraries.

I generally add more as a I use the libraries with the articulations, so expect this list to grow over time.

If you like this and find it useful, please consider a contribution in the form of listening to my music, either on Spotify/Apple Music or via Bandcamp:
