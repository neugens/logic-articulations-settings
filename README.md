# logic-articulations-settings
A Collection of articulations settings for various libraries for Logic Pro X
and a collection of Logig Pro MIDI FX Scripter plugins.

[Articulations]

To install the articulations files, simply clone the repository and copy
the files your (or the whole directories as needed) into you
local "~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings" directory.

The project maintains a directory structure for easy of use and
it will show as a hierarchy insdie Logic Pro, which is very convenient
especially if you have a lot of libraries.

I generally add more as a I use the libraries with the articulations,
so expect this list to grow over time.

The Spitfire Audio libraries use the UACC KS standard.

If you want to know more about Logic Pro articulation set,
please refer to this article:

[Scripter ultities]

This project also contains a list of Scripter utilities for Logic Pro X.
Logic creates optimised binary files on the fly, so in order to install
the script you need to create a blank scripter project and then paste
the code in the editor and execute the script.
